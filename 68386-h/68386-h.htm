<h2 class="nobreak">The Diviner.</h2>
</div>


<p>The point of this trick consists in divining a
word which is named, together with several others.
Two of the players commonly agree between
themselves to place it after an object that has four
legs; for instance, a quadruped, a table, etc., etc.</p>

<p><em>Example.</em>—If Emily wishes to have Henry guess
the word which Susan has secretly told her, she
says to him, “Susan has been shopping; she has
bought a rose, a dress, some jewelry, a table, a
bonnet, a shawl——” Henry, of course, will easily
guess that the object in question is a <em>bonnet</em>,
for the word “<em>table</em>,” which precedes it, has four
legs.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">To Walk Upon a Hot Iron Bar.</h2>
</div>


<p>Take half an ounce of camphor, dissolve it in
two ounces of aqua vitæ, add to it one of quicksilver,
one ounce of liquid storax, which is the
droppings of myrrh, and prevents the camphor
from firing; take also two ounces of hematis,
which is a red stone, to be had at the druggists’;
and when you buy it, let them beat it into a powder
in their great mortar, for, being very hard, it cannot
well be reduced in a small one; add this to the<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
ingredients already specified, and when you purpose
to walk upon the bar, anoint your feet well
with it, and you may do so without the slightest
danger.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Restored Ribbon.</h2>
</div>


<p>Have two pieces of colored ribbon of exactly the
same size and appearance, one of which, being
damped, may be secured in the palm of the hand,
previous to exhibiting. The other may be cut in
pieces and burned in a plate by the audience.
Taking now the ashes, you call for a basin of
water, with which you moisten them, stating by
the magical influence of the “cold water cure,”
the color and form of the burned ribbon will be
restored. Rubbing the damp ashes in the hand,
you draw forth, at the same time, the concealed
ribbon, which will appear to be the same that had
been consumed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Interesting Problems.</h2>
</div>


<p>By steeping an egg in vinegar for some time it
can be made pliable enough to be stuffed into a
bottle. Then restore the egg to its natural shape
by pouring water into the bottle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How to Drop a Tumbler on the Floor
Without Breaking It.</h2>
</div>


<p>This requires a steady hand and smooth table.<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
You simply set a tumbler upon a table near the
edge and gently push the tumbler with your forefinger
until it is very nicely balanced upon the
edge of the table. Now by giving the tumbler a
very gentle push again it will fall to the floor,
striking upon its bottom edge, and remain standing
either upon its bottom or lying upon its side
perfectly sound. Be careful and have no covering
upon the table, as the less friction you can get
the surer you are to perform your trick.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Magic Money.</h2>
</div>


<p>This conjuring trick is performed thus: Procure
two quarters and a half-dollar; conceal one of the
quarters in the <em>right</em> hand; lay the other quarter
and the half-dollar on a table, in full view of the
audience; now ask for two handkerchiefs; then
take the half-dollar up, and pretend to roll it in
one of the handkerchiefs; but, in lieu thereof, roll
up the quarter, which you had concealed, and retain
the half-dollar; give the handkerchief to one
of the company to hold; now take the quarter off
the table, and pretend to roll that up in the second
handkerchief; but put up the half-dollar instead;
give this handkerchief to another person, and beg
him to “hold it tight,” while you utter, “Presto!
fly!” On opening the handkerchiefs the money
will appear to have changed places. This is one
of the best tricks in this book.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Sorcery.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a somewhat singular trick. One of the
party is placed behind a screen in an adjoining
room, where he cannot possibly see the players—or
may be blindfolded. One of the party must
then call out, “Do you know Miss ——?” naming
a lady’s name. “Yes.” “Do you know her
dress?” “Yes.” “Her wreath, her slippers,
her gloves and her bracelets?” “Yes.” “Her
handkerchief?” “Yes.” “Her fan?” “Yes.”
“Well, then, since you know her dress so well, tell
me what article of her costume I am now touching?”
If the one behind the screen is acquainted
with the trick, he will, of course, answer directly,
“her bracelet,” the only article mentioned which
has the word “and” before it.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Odd or Even.</h2>
</div>


<p>To tell in which hand of a person, having an odd
number in one hand and an even number in the
other, the odd or even number is. Desire the person
to multiply the number in his right hand by a
figure which is an odd number, and the number in
his left by an even one; and to say if the products
added together are odd or even. If even, the even
number is in the right hand; if odd, the even number
is in the left hand.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">To Discover Card by Weight.</h2>
</div>


<p>Desire any person in company to draw a card
from the pack, and when he has looked at it, to
return it to you with its face downward; then,
pretending to weigh it nicely, take notice of any
particular mark on the back of the card, which,
having done, put it among the rest of the cards,
and desire the person to shuffle them as much as
he pleases; then, receiving the pack from his
hands, you pretend to weigh each card as before,
and proceed in this way until you discover, from
the back of it, the particular card he selected.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How Money is Saved.</h2>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Eatable Candle-Ends.</h2>
</div>


<p>Take a large apple and cut out a few pieces in
the shape of candle-ends, round at the bottom and
flat at the top, in fact, as much like a piece of
candle as possible. Now cut some slips from a
sweet almond, as near as you can to resemble a
wick, and stick them into the imitation candles.
Light them for an instant to make the tops black,
blow them out, and they are ready for the trick.
One or two should be artfully placed in a snuffer-tray,
or candlestick; you then inform your friends
that during your “travels in the Russian Empire,”
you learned, like the Russians, to be fond of candles;
at the same time lighting your artificial
candles (the almonds will readily take fire and
flame for a few seconds), pop them into your
mouth, and swallow them one after the other.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Wonderful Hat.</h2>
</div>


<p>Upon a table place three pieces of bread, or any
other eatable, at a little distance from each other,
and cover each with a hat, take up the first hat,
and removing the bread put it into your mouth,
letting the company see that you swallow it, then
raise the second hat, and eat the bread which was
under that, then proceed to the third hat in the
same manner. Having eaten the three pieces,<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
ask any person in the company to choose which
hat he would like the three pieces of bread to be
under, and when he has made his choice of one of
the hats, put it on your head, and ask him if he
does not think they are under it. By the way, if
you are interested in tricks, let us call your attention
to Prof. Roltair’s celebrated cabinet of magic.
It contains twenty-five new and startling tricks
with complete apparatus, so that you can easily
give a two hour’s entertainment. Among the numerous
tricks are: The load of articles from a
borrowed hat, such as cannon balls, cabbages,
boxes, etc.; the famous ink and water trick, with
apparatus, so that you can instantly change a
glass of ink to clear water, new and surprising
card tricks including a pack of wizard’s cards, the
famous dancing skeleton, true secret of ventriloquism,
by means of which you can learn to throw
the voice into hay-lofts, closets, trunks, etc., magic
wand, and many other wonderful sleight of hand
marvels are all contained in Prof. Roltair’s cabinet.
The regular price is two dollars, but you can
now obtain it, complete, postpaid, by sending fifty
cents in stamps or money order to W. S. Everett
&amp; Co., 113 Munroe Street, Lynn, Mass., or the
firm from whom you purchased this book.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Invisible Coin.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Is silver a visible or invisible thing?” What a<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
singular question! You will reply, certainly silver
is a visible thing. A good many poor creatures,
however, are of a different opinion; and possibly
they are not altogether wrong, as we are about to
show.</p>

<p>Will you kindly lend me a quarter, having first
marked it, that you may know it again. Very
well! There is a little handkerchief which will
serve for me to make the experiment I have promised
you. In the middle of this handkerchief, as
you will perceive, I will put the quarter, which
you have marked with a small cross. I am only
folding the handkerchief that the quarter may be
well wrapped up in it; you can have no difficulty
in recognizing its shape. However! You are suspicious!
I will make an improvement. There, sir,
hold the handkerchief yourself, first above the
little parcel formed by the coin. You may touch
it, and convince yourself that it is still in its place.
Now, I take the handkerchief by the opposite corner,
I draw it toward me, unfolding it entirely; I
then turn it over, shake it, and wave it in the air,
to convince you that the coin has disappeared.
The fact is evident. But, did you see it go? No!
Certainly, then, silver is sometimes an invisible
body.</p>

<p>Which fact you may prove by the foregoing
process, if you have a handkerchief in one corner<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
of which a quarter dollar has been sewed. You
appear to put the borrowed quarter in the middle
of the said handkerchief; then, instead of this
coin, which you retain in your hand, concealed between
the fore and middle fingers, you fold the
handkerchief making the little parcel in the middle
with the quarter sewed in the corner, in a sort
of hem, so that the coin is not seen, and cannot
drop out. When you quickly pull the handkerchief
out of the hand which held it, the illusion is
complete.</p>

<p>As to the marked coin which it is easy for you to
have put on the table, or in your pocket, you may
make it reappear in a cup, a box, or anything
else, which adds to the effect of the trick you have
performed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Wizard Skeleton.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is an animated figure, fourteen inches high.
It represents a skeleton, miniature but lifelike in
appearance. You may pass it around for examination,
then stand it upon the floor and it will begin
to dance without any visible motive power.
Just think of it! People will imagine that ghosts
or demons are near. This trick can be done in any
room very easily. The skeleton will dance to
music, jump, lie down, etc., just as you command.
We will send the apparatus and secret of Wizard<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
Skeleton for 6 cents in stamps. Address, A. B.
Courtney &amp; Co., 493 Washington street, Lynn,
Mass., or the firm from whom you purchased this
book.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Magic Writing.</h2>
</div>


<p>Present a person with a slip of paper, a pen and
a tumbler of water, and desire him to dip the pen
in the tumbler, and write down whatever he
pleases. When dry, the words will be invisible,
but, if the paper is immersed in the contents of
the tumbler, the writing will make its appearance
quite distinctly. To perform this the pen should
be a quill one, and new, and the water in the tumbler
should have one or two crystals of sulphate of
iron (green vitriol) previously dissolved in it, while
the writer should be careful the pen does not get
dry in use. When the writing has been executed,
the tumbler should be taken away, on pretence of
the water being rather dirty, and wanting changing;
another similar tumbler is brought back,
filled to the same height with water, in which a
few drops of tincture of galls have been poured.
When the paper is immersed in this, the writing
will quickly appear.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Columbus Egg Trick.</h2>
</div>


<p>To make an egg stand on one end on any polished
surface seems very extraordinary, yet it can<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
be done, even on a looking-glass. Now, from the
form of an egg, nothing is more liable to roll, and
on nothing more so than on a looking-glass. To
accomplish this trick, let the performer take an
egg in his hand, and while he keeps talking and
staring in the face of his audience give it two or
three hearty shakes; this will break the yolk,
which will sink to one end, and consequently make
it more heavy, by which when it is settled you
may make it, with a steady hand, stand upon the
glass; this would be impossible while it continued
in its proper state.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Ring and the Handkerchief.</h2>
</div>


<p>Previously provide yourself with a piece of brass
wire pointed at both ends, and bent round so as to
form a ring about the size of a wedding-ring,
which conceal in your hand; then commence your
performance by borrowing from a gentleman a silk
pocket-handkerchief, and from a lady a wedding-ring;
request some person to hold two of the
corners of the handkerchief, and another to hold
the other two, keeping them at full stretch. You
next exhibit the wedding-ring to the company,
and announce to them that you will make it pass
through the handkerchief. Then place your hand
under the handkerchief, and substituting the false
ring which you have previously concealed, press<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
it against the centre of the handkerchief, and desire
a third person to take hold of the ring through
the handkerchief, and to close his finger and
thumb through the middle of the ring. Hold the
handkerchief in this manner to show that the
ring has not been placed within a fold. Now desire
the persons holding the corners of the handkerchief
to let go, the person holding the ring
(through the handkerchief as already described)
still retaining his hold. Let another person now
grasp the handkerchief as tight as he pleases
three or four inches below the ring, and tell the
person holding the ring to let it go, when it will be
quite evident to the company that the ring is secure
within the centre of the handkerchief. Then
request the person who grasps the handkerchief
to hold a hat over it, pass your hand underneath
and open the false ring, by bending one of its
points a little aside, and bring one point gently
through the handkerchief, the remainder may
easily be drawn out,—be careful to rub the hole
you have made in the handkerchief with your
finger and thumb to conceal the fracture. You
then put the wedding-ring you borrowed over the
outside of the handkerchief, and desiring the person
who holds the hat to take it away, exhibit the
ring (placed as described) to the company, and
while their attention is engaged, taking the opportunity<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
of concealing, or getting rid of the brass
ring.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Smashed Watch.</h2>
</div>


<p>You request some one of the company to lend
you a watch, and put it immediately into a mortar;
a few moments afterward you cause it to be
pounded, by another person, with a pestle; you
exhibit the wheels, face, mainspring, and drum
barrel broken and smashed; and finally, after a
few minutes, you return the watch, whole and
safe, to the proprietor, who recognizes it.</p>

<p>After all that we have said, it will easily be perceived
that the mortar must be placed near the
trap in the table of which we spoke in the last
trick, and covered with a napkin, in order that the
confederate may substitute another watch.</p>

<p>To produce a complete illusion in this case, you
must take care to put in the mortar a second
watch, the hands, works, and case of which should,
in some degree, resemble those of the borrowed
one. And this is by no means difficult; for you
can either have an understanding with the person
lending the watch, or you may manage to ask the
loan of some one whom you have seen elsewhere,
and whose watch you may have had an opportunity
of examining shortly before, with a view
of procuring a similar one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>After replacing the fragments in the mortar,
cover them a second time with the napkin, and
amuse the company with a riddle or conundrum,
or by some other tricks, to give your partner time
to collect all the bits, and replace the perfect
watch in the mortar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Magic Stick.</h2>
</div>


<p>The principal actor in this trick takes his place
in the center of the room armed with a long stick,
with which he describes several circles, etc., on
the carpet, at the same time muttering a mock
incantation, after which he touches one of the
company (his accomplice) on the shoulder, bidding
him quit the room, preparatory to guessing
on whom the magic stick would pause in its evolutions.
The magician then touches several of the
company, one after another, lightly, with his
wand, each time saying, “The wand passes,” until
he allows it to pause at one particular person,
saying, “The wand rests.” His accomplice immediately
names the person <em>who has spoken last</em>;
this being the one indicated by the stick. The
person leaving the room must, of course, be
within hearing, and the magician must artfully
encourage the company to keep up a conversation.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
